# Exploring Predictive Models for Student Performance: A Case Study in Life Science Calculus I Exam Data Modeling

## 1. Real-World Problem Statement
**Full statement of the problem:**  
Can we build predictive models using Exam 1 and Exam 2 scores to estimate student performance in Calculus I? 

Since final grades are not yet available, we will compare the outputs of multiple modeling approaches to understand their assumptions, behaviors and potential for future use.

## Assumptions
1. **Exam scores reflect student learning and effort.**  
   Exams are standardized and graded consistently.  
2. **In absence of final grade data, Exam 3 can serve as a proxy** for overall performance.  
3. **All exam scores use a consistent scale.**
4. **All exams cover the same amount of content**
5. **All exams have the same difficulty**

*Why these are sensible:*  
- Midterm exams are major components of grade and correlate with understanding.  
- Using Exam 3 avoids waiting for end-of-term grades.  
- Consistent scales ensure comparability across models.
