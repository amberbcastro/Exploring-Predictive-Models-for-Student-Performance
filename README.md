# Exploring Predictive Models for Student Performance: A Case Study in Life Science Calculus I Exam Data Modeling
Can we build predictive models using Exam 1 and Exam 2 scores to estimate student performance in Calculus I? 

Since final grades are not yet available, we will compare the outputs of multiple modeling approaches to understand their assumptions, behaviors and potential for future use.
